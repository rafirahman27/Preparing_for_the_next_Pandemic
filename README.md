# Preparing for the next Pandemic:
## An analysis of the Covid-19 Pandemic at the State and County Levels

## Problem Statement
In 2023, with the total number of new coronavirus cases decreasing and the Pandemic beginning to stabilize, Congress directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct an in-depth analysis of the coronavirus pandemic. After more than 1 million Americans died during the pandemic, Congress tasked HHS with creating a report detailing how the response to Pandemic could have been improved as well as crafting a resiliency plan aimed at reducing death tolls of future pandemics. 

HHS received funding for this analysis and hired our consulting firm, FF consulting, to develop machine learning models that could explain which variables were most strongly linked to covid outcomes. HHS specifically was interested not only in different policy explanations, but also asked us to consider demographics such as age and race, the pre-existing health conditions of the populations, income, education, and any other factors we found to be potentially causational. 

## Background:
Both in terms of total deaths, as well as deaths per capita, The United States fared worse than most other countries during the coronavirus pandemic. In the United States, more than 341 people out of 100,000 died due to coronavirus. Only Peru had per population more deaths than the United States (John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center). Some states and counties within the United States fared better or worse than others (Lancet study). 

With the pandemic occurring so recently, there are few comprehensive studies examining the links between coronavirus outcomes and different factors such as demographic differences or policy choices. However we were able to find a few studies examining coronavirus outcomes in the United States and abroad.

Authors Thomas J Bollyky, Emma Castro, Aleksandr Y Aravkin, Kayleight Bhangdia, Jeremy Dalos, Erin Hulland et al. conducted a comparative study of covid deaths in each state and Washington DC from Jan 1, 2020 to July 31, 2022. Their findings included:
- "A lower poverty rate, higher mean number of years of education, and a greater proportion of people expressing interpersonal trust were statistically associated with lower infection and death rates"
- "states where larger percentages of the population identify as Black (non-Hispanic) or Hispanic were associated with higher cumulative death rates"
- "Access to quality health care (measured by the IHME's Healthcare Access and Quality Index) was associated with fewer total COVID-19 deaths and SARS-CoV-2 infections"
- "but higher public health spending and more public health personnel per capita were not, at the state level."
- "The political affiliation of the state governor was not associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 death rates"
- "Worse COVID-19 outcomes were associated with the proportion of a state's voters who voted for the 2020 Republican presidential candidate."
- "State governments' uses of protective mandates were associated with lower infection rates, as were mask use, lower mobility, and higher vaccination rate, while vaccination rates were associated with lower death rates."
- "Employment, however, had a statistically significant relationship with restaurant closures and greater infections and deaths: on average, 1574 (95% UI 884–7107) additional infections per 10 000 population were associated in states with a one percentage point increase in employment rate."

Author Parth Patel examined racial disparities within Covid-19 outcomes in the United Kingdom. Patel explains the signficant disparity in death and case rates were much higher among the "Black, Asian and Ethnic Minority" communities.

Authors Jacob Wallace, Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, and Jason L. Schwartz, compared Ohio and Florida from March 2020 to December 2021 to examine the question, "Was political party affiliation a risk factor associated with excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida and Ohio?" The authors found evidence of a strong political component to Covid-19 deaths; "excess mortality was significantly higher for Republican voters than Democratic voters after COVID-19 vaccines were available to all adults, but not before. These differences were concentrated in counties with lower vaccination rates, and primarily noted in voters residing in Ohio."

Authors Andrew C. Stokes, Dielle J. Lundberg,Irma T. Elo Katherine Hempstead, Jacob Bor, and Samuel H. Preston found strong evidence that "direct Covid-19 death counts in the United States in 2020 substantially underestimated total excess mortality attributable to Covid-19." The authors also found evidence that under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths was exacerbated by racial and socio-economic disparties. They also noted a regional component, with states in the South and West more likely to report the cause of death as something other than coronavirus.

## Methodology:
In order to build off of existing literature and work towards a comprehensive understanding of factors related to/ driving Coronavirus outcomes, we examined cases and deaths at both the State and County levels from the beginning of 2020 through December 31, 2022. We obtained data at the state level covering pre-existing health conditions, employment, income, education, demographics, health behaviors, mask policies, vaccination rates, insurance rates, and population size and density. At the county level we were not able to obtain standardized data regarding health behaviors but were able to find racial and age demographics for the overall population, vaccination rates, cases, and deaths as well as multiple measures of income inequality.  

The factors we considered in our state models:
- Pre-existing medical conditions
- Demographics
- Income
- Age
- Housing Crisis
- Population Size
- Population Density
- Employment
- Percent population insured
- Mask Policy (Duration of policy)
- Vaccination Rates
- Behaviors (ie wearing a mask, visiting friends)

The factors in our county models:
- Pre-existing medical conditions
- Racial Demographics
- Income
- Age
- Housing Crisis
- Income Inequality
- Segregation
- Population Size
- Rural vs Urban
- Employment
- Percent population insured
- Mask Policy (Number of days a policy was in place)
- Vaccination Rates
- Air Quality

## Data Cleaning & EDA:
Initial data cleaning of large csv files took place in the Data Collection and Cleaning notebook found in the Code folder. The size of large files was reduced by selecting the minimum variables of interest for time periods of signficance. The smaller dataframes were then saved as CSVs in the code folder and re-accessed in the Data Cleaning and EDA notbeook. We cleaned individual data sets from the various sources and then combined the datasets into a county dataframe and a state dataframe. Most of the data had few typos and errors, however there was missing data for some variables. NJ did not report rates for pre-existing medical conditions in 2019 and therefore the 2018 statistics were substituted in. Other features of interest at the county level such as income by race and other variables by race were dropped due to a large amount of missing data. The segregation index for example was dropped from the final county model to retain as many observations as possible. At the county level, some cases and deaths were attributed to a state but not a specific county. For the county-level analysis, we used counties' share of the states population to re-allocate these cases and deaths to specific counties within a state. While more than 20 states had some unallocated deaths, only a handful had a significant number (more than 1-2% of overall cases and deaths). 

## Modeling:
Our goal with modeling was two-fold:
1. Develop model(s) that predicted Covid-19 outcomes as successfully as possible
2. Develop model(s) that could be used to interpret the relationships between certain features and different outcomes.

We developed models with multiple target variables to understand covid-19 outcomes through a broader lense. We looked at both deaths attributed to covid-19 as well as excess death statistics. Excess deaths were examined due to multiple studies suggesting that covid-19 deaths were being consistently under-reported, especially among poor and minority communities. We also examined covid-19 cases as cases also had a significant impact on populations and communities. When discussing the analysis

As we were concerned with understanding the relationships between specific features and covid-19 outcomes, we first developed white-box linear regression models at both the state and county level. The results of the State models led us to begin the county-level analysis. In the OLS Stats Summary Table for the state-level linear regression model, p-values for all variables are missing. There are two strong possibilities for why this was the case. First, while the model's r2 metric was very strong, the model contains multiple collinear variables that can muddy the interpretation of individual variables. Second, at the state level we only had 51 observations including Puerto Rico. This is a very small sample size and makes it difficult to make conclusions about the true relationships between features and the y-variables. This OLS Stats summary table and modeling analysis can be found in Code-> Extra Models. Since the state level models could not provide statistically significant interpretations of specific variables, we developed a county-level linear regression model. This linear regression model had a strong r2 score and was able to account for 93% of variability in the validation data. Further, the p-values of multiple variables were small showing the coefficient to be statistically significant. 



## Analysis/ Conclusions:
We attempted to utilize a stronger black box state model for analysis by manually changing values to create 'what-if' scenarios. However, due to the amount of features in the black box model, even changing the value of multiple variables significantly had little to no effect on predicted outcomes. Therefore, we focused more on the county-level models to analyze specific relationships. 

### At the county-level:
We conducted a handful of white box and black box models on a county basis, to predict total number of cases and total number of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Surprisingly, our white box models were among the most accurate. For example, our linear regression model predicting case count had a test score of 0.93, with as few as 8 x-variables. Below is a table of the largest positive and negative coefficients for our complete linear regression model predicting cases by county. 
Key Variable 	Coefficient
percent Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander	-3,673.5
Percent Unemployed	-1,178.9
Average Daily PM2.5	-1,033.1
percent_smokers	-771.1
percent Excessive Drinking	-409.1
percent African American	1,746.4
percent Hispanic	1,876.8
percent Non-Hispanic White	1,960.5
percent American Indian/Alaskan Native	2,064.7
water	2,682.2

Our linear regression model that predicted deaths on a county basis had an accuracy of 0.90. Some of the strongest coefficients (positive or negative) are displayed in the table below. 
 Variable Name	Coefficient
percent Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander	-196.4
Food Environment Index	-30.6
Percent Food Insecure	-23.0
% Fair/Poor Health	-17.7
Inadequate Facilities	-11.3
Percent Insufficient Sleep	27.3
percent Non-Hispanic White	28.1
percent Hispanic	29.2
percent American Indian/Alaskan Native	33.7
water	50.3

The first black box model we would like to highlight was the Extra Trees (ET) w/ Random Search CV model, which predicted total cases on a county level. This model had a test score of 0.90 After performing a Random Search CV with 100 iterations, we found ideal model features of 2,000 estimators, minimum samples leaf of 2, maximum features of 44, and a max depth of 50. Below are the key features of the model, along with their significance. 
 Features	Importance
Population	0.691067
percent Asian	0.059093
Percent Severe Housing Problems	0.055242
Severe Housing Cost Burden	0.023799
Average Daily PM2.5	0.018630
percent Not Proficient in English	0.018506
Overcrowding	0.016577

The other black box model we would like to highlight was the Random Forest (RF) w/ GradBoost & Random Search CV model, which predicted total deaths on a county level. This model had a test score of 0.91. After performing a Random Search CV with 100 iterations, we found ideal model features of 200 estimators, maximum features of 43 and maximum of depth. Below are the key features of the model, along with their significance.
 Features	Importance
Population	0.725828
Inadequate Facilities	0.196904
Percent Severe Housing Problems	0.018299
Segregation index black/white	0.012491
Severe Housing Cost Burden	0.009958
% Physically Inactive	0.009101
Income Ratio	0.003917

## Initial Findings & Reccomendations:
We found that while specific policies such as mask mandates did make an impact on covid-19 outcomes, one of the strongest and potentially most overlooked factors in predicting the variability in covid-19 outcomes was inequality. We found significantly signficant relationships between the racial demographics of specific counties and covid-19 deaths as well as significant relationships with metrics of inequality such as housing problems, segregation, median income, income inequality, and access to clean water. 

Our reccommendation is to focus on preparing for the next pandemic by focusing on policies that
- Reduce racial segregation and inequality
- Increase healthcare access
- Increase trust in public health officials and organizations
- Increase public trust in vaccines
- Increase healthcare access and insurance rates



## Next Steps & Further Study:
With more time, we believe experimenting with the following feature engineering steps would yield stronger models with less features and easier interpretability.
Further Data Engineering:
- Combining similar/collinear variables into index variables
    - vaccination rate index
    - health behaviors index
    - pre-existing health of the population index
    - inequality
    - insurance rates/ healthcare access
- Use PCA to reduce dimensionality & combine factors into 1 to 3 variables
    - Pre-existing health conditions
    - Income & Education
    - Political Factors
    - Segregation/ Diversity
    - Strength/ amount of healthcare infrastructure

Further Data Collection:
- Health behaviors at the county level
- Racial demographics at the state level
- Political leanings at state and county level (voter registrations)

Future Models:
In our initial modeling process, we explored multiple y-variables (excess deaths, total deaths attributed to covid-19, and total cases). 
- Time series utilizing policy implementation dates, vaccination rates over time, and covid-19 cases and deaths, vaccination rates
- Clustering counties and then analyzing clusters in black box and white-box models
